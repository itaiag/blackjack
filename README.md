# blackjack
This is a very simple implementation of the Blackjack game in Python. 
This was made as part of my effort to better learn the Python programming language. 

## Requirements
The game doe's not require any special dependencies (except Python, of course), but if you want also some 
terminal colors you should install *colorama*

````
> pip install colorama
````
